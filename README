Can't get sub-sub-process coverage working properly. Original was with
Twisted, trying a subprocess.Popen one.

This one uses the simplest possible way to simulate what I'm doing,
which is: using py.test to run some things (using fixtures), launching
those things via "coverage run -p" directly, with a subprocess (of
py.test) that itself has a sub-process.

A "successful" run of this example should produce *two* .coverage.*
files, whereas most of the variations (see code, uncomment things)
only produce one.




Separately, I've also tried every variation I could think of:

 - launching the subprocess with "coverage run" with -p, -a

 - using sitecustomize.py as suggested in docs (versus "coverage run")

 - using coverage run with just --rcfile, and absolute path

 - always using absolute path into /tmp/testing venv
